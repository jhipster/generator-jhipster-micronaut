## Installing and Using the Active Development Version

This currently active development branch is based on the latest production release of JHipster - v7.9.3.

As a pre-requisite, you must have NodeJS v16.x installed, along with the bundled version of NPM.

1. Start by installing JHipster v7.9.3 with

```
npm install -g generator-jhipster@7
```

2. Then install this in-development blueprint by

```
git clone https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-micronaut.git
cd generator-jhipster-micronaut
git checkout micronaut-3
npm link generator-jhipster
npm install
npm link
```

3. Next you can create a new application with the development version of this blueprint by executing:

```
mkdir my-project
cd my-project
npm link "generator-jhipster-micronaut"
mhipster --skip-jhipster-dependencies
```

This will execute the mhipster CLI tool that walks you through a series of steps to generate the code for your application.

Alternatively, you can generate an application based on one of the samples in https://github.com/jhipster/jdl-samples

For example, to generate a default gradle-based application, execute:

```
mkdir my-jdl-project
cd my-jdl-project
npm link "generator-jhipster-micronaut"
mhipster jdl default-gradle --skip-jhipster-dependencies
```

You will re-execute the commands in step 3 for any new application that you would like to generate with this in-development version.

This project generates a Micronaut based JHipster application üòé.
It is based on JHipster Blueprint üîµ, and intends to replace the Spring Boot portions of the server with [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io) equivalents.

## Installation and Usage

1. Install MHipster
   - `npm install -g generator-jhipster-micronaut`
2. Create a new folder for your application
3. Start MHipster
   - `mhipster`

Alternatively, if you already have JHipster installed, you can use this blueprint with:

```
$ jhipster --blueprints micronaut
```

## Using Docker

Download the Dockerfile:

```bash
mkdir docker
cd docker
wget https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-micronaut/raw/main/docker/Dockerfile
```

Build the Docker images:

```bash
docker build -t jhipster-generator-micronaut:latest .
```

Make a folder where you want to generate the Service:

```bash
mkdir service
cd service
```

Run the generator from image to generate service:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/home/jhipster/app jhipster-generator-micronaut
```

Run and attach interactive shell to the generator docker container to work from inside the running container:

```bash
docker run -it --rm -v $PWD:/home/jhipster/app jhipster-generator-micronaut /bin/bash
```
