This application was generated with [MHipster](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-micronaut), a [Micronaut](https://micronaut.io) blueprint for [JHipster](https://www.jhipster.tech)!
You can find documentation and help at [https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-micronaut](https://github.com/jhipster/generator-jhipster-micronaut).

## Development

<%_ if (skipClient) { _%>
To start your application in the dev profile, run:

    <% if (buildTool === 'maven') { %>./mvnw<% } %><% if (buildTool === 'gradle') { %>./gradlew<% } %>

<%_ } _%>
<%_ if (!skipClient) { _%>
Before you can build this project, you must install and configure the following dependencies on your machine:

1. [Node.js][]: We use Node to run a development web server and build the project.
   Depending on your system, you can install Node either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.
<%_ if (clientPackageManager === 'yarn') { _%>
2. [Yarn][]: We use Yarn to manage Node dependencies.
   Depending on your system, you can install Yarn either from source or as a pre-packaged bundle.
<%_ } _%>

After installing Node, you should be able to run the following command to install development tools.
You will only need to run this command when dependencies change in [package.json](package.json).

    <%= clientPackageManager %> install

We use <%= clientPackageManager %> scripts and [Webpack][] as our build system.

Run the following commands in two separate terminals to create a blissful development experience where your browser
auto-refreshes when files change on your hard drive.
<% if (buildTool === 'maven') { %>
    ./mvnw<% } %><% if (buildTool === 'gradle') { %>
    ./gradlew -x webpack<% } %>
    <%= clientPackageManager %> start

<%= clientPackageMngrName %> is also used to manage CSS and JavaScript dependencies used in this application. You can upgrade dependencies by
specifying a newer version in [package.json](package.json). You can also run `<%= clientPackageManager %> update` and `<%= clientPackageManager %> install` to manage dependencies.
Add the `help` flag on any command to see how you can use it. For example, `<%= clientPackageManager %> help update`.

The `<%= clientPackageManager %> run` command will list all of the scripts available to run for this project.
<%_ if (authenticationType === 'oauth2') { _%>

## OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect

Congratulations! You've selected an excellent way to secure your JHipster application. If you're not sure what OAuth and OpenID Connect (OIDC) are, please see [What the Heck is OAuth?](https://developer.okta.com/blog/2017/06/21/what-the-heck-is-oauth)

To log in to your app, you'll need to have [Keycloak](https://keycloak.org) up and running. The JHipster Team has created a Docker container for you that has the default users and roles. Start Keycloak using the following command.

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/keycloak.yml up
```

The security settings in `src/main/resources/config/application.yml` are configured for this image.

```yaml
micronaut:
  ...
  security:
    oauth2:
      enabled: true
      clients:
        oidc:
          client-secret: web_app
          client-id: web_app
          openid:
            issuer: http://localhost:9080/auth/realms/jhipster
      login-uri: /oauth2/authorization{/provider}
      callback-uri: /oauth2/callback{/provider}
```

<%_ } _%>

### PWA Support

JHipster ships with PWA (Progressive Web App) support, and it's turned off by default. One of the main components of a PWA is a service worker.

The service worker initialization code is commented out by default. To enable it, uncomment the following code in `src/main/webapp/index.html`:

```html
<script>
    if ('serviceWorker' in navigator) {
        navigator.serviceWorker
        .register('./service-worker.js')
        .then(function() { console.log('Service Worker Registered'); });
    }
</script>
```

Note: [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/) powers JHipster's service worker. It dynamically generates the `service-worker.js` file.

### Managing dependencies

For example, to add [Leaflet][] library as a runtime dependency of your application, you would run following command:

    <%= clientPackageManager %> <%= clientPackageMngrAdd %> leaflet

To benefit from TypeScript type definitions from [DefinitelyTyped][] repository in development, you would run following command:

    <%= clientPackageManager %> <%= clientPackageMngrAddDev %> @types/leaflet

Then you would import the JS and CSS files specified in library's installation instructions so that [Webpack][] knows about them:
<%_ if (clientFrameworkAngular) { _%>
Edit [<%= CLIENT_MAIN_SRC_DIR %>app/vendor.ts](<%= CLIENT_MAIN_SRC_DIR %>app/vendor.ts) file:
~~~
import 'leaflet/dist/leaflet.js';
~~~

Edit [<%= CLIENT_MAIN_SRC_DIR %>content/scss/vendor.scss](<%= CLIENT_MAIN_SRC_DIR %>content/scss/vendor.scss) file:
~~~
@import '~leaflet/dist/leaflet.css';
~~~
<%_ } _%>
Note: There are still a few other things remaining to do for Leaflet that we won't detail here.
<%_ } _%>

For further instructions on how to develop with JHipster, have a look at [Using JHipster in development][].

<%_ if (clientFrameworkAngular && applicationType !== 'microservice') { _%>
### Using Angular CLI

You can also use [Angular CLI][] to generate some custom client code.

For example, the following command:

    ng generate component my-component

will generate few files:

    create <%= CLIENT_MAIN_SRC_DIR %>app/my-component/my-component.component.html
    create <%= CLIENT_MAIN_SRC_DIR %>app/my-component/my-component.component.ts
    update <%= CLIENT_MAIN_SRC_DIR %>app/app.module.ts
<%_ } _%>
<%_ if (enableSwaggerCodegen) { _%>
### Doing API-First development using openapi-generator

[OpenAPI-Generator]() is configured for this application. You can generate API code from the `src/main/resources/swagger/api.yml` definition file by running:
    <%_ if (buildTool === 'maven') { _%>
```bash
./mvnw generate-sources
```
    <%_ } _%>
    <%_ if (buildTool === 'gradle') { _%>
```bash
./gradlew openApiGenerate
```
    <%_ } _%>
Then implements the generated delegate classes with `@Singleton` classes.

To edit the `api.yml` definition file, you can use a tool such as [Swagger-Editor](). Start a local instance of the swagger-editor using docker by running: `docker-compose -f src/main/docker/swagger-editor.yml up -d`. The editor will then be reachable at [http://localhost:7742](http://localhost:7742).

Refer to [Doing API-First development][] for more details.
<%_ } _%>

## Building for production

### Packaging as jar

To build a jar, run:
<% if (buildTool === 'maven') { %>
    Use `./mvnw clean verify`
<% } %>
<% if (buildTool === 'gradle') { %>
    ./gradlew clean jar
<% } %>

<%_ if (!skipClient) { _%>
This will concatenate and minify the client CSS and JavaScript files. It will also modify `index.html` so it references these new files.
<%_ } _%>
To ensure everything worked, run:
<% if (buildTool === 'maven') { %>
    java -jar target/*.jar<% } %><% if (buildTool === 'gradle') { %>
    java -jar build/libs/*.jar<% } %>

<% if (!skipClient) { %>Then navigate to [http://localhost:<%= serverPort %>](http://localhost:<%= serverPort %>) in your browser.
<% } %>
Refer to [Using JHipster in production][] for more details.

## Testing

To launch your application's tests, run:

    <%_ if (buildTool === 'maven') { _%>
    ./mvnw verify
    <%_ } else { _%>
    ./gradlew test integrationTest jacocoTestReport
    <%_ } _%>
<% if (!skipClient) { %>
### Client tests

Unit tests are run by [Jest][] and written with [Jasmine][]. They're located in [<%= CLIENT_TEST_SRC_DIR %>](<%= CLIENT_TEST_SRC_DIR %>) and can be run with:

    <%= clientPackageManager %> test

<% if (protractorTests) { %>UI end-to-end tests are powered by [Protractor][], which is built on top of WebDriverJS. They're located in [<%= CLIENT_TEST_SRC_DIR %>e2e](<%= CLIENT_TEST_SRC_DIR %>e2e)
and can be run by starting Spring Boot in one terminal (`<% if (buildTool === 'maven') { %>./mvnw spring-boot:run<% } else { %>./gradlew bootRun<% } %>`) and running the tests (`<%= clientPackageManager %> run e2e`) in a second one.<% } %>
<% } %>
For more information, refer to the [Running tests page][].

### Code quality

Sonar is used to analyse code quality. You can start a local Sonar server (accessible on http://localhost:9001) with:

```
docker-compose -f src/main/docker/sonar.yml up -d
```

You can run a Sonar analysis with using the [sonar-scanner](https://docs.sonarqube.org/display/SCAN/Analyzing+with+SonarQube+Scanner)<% if (buildTool) { %> or by using the <% if (buildTool === 'maven') { %>maven<% } %><% if (buildTool === 'gradle') { %>gradle<% } %> plugin<% } %>.

Then, run a Sonar analysis:

<%_ if (buildTool === 'maven') { _%>
```
./mvnw -Pprod clean verify sonar:sonar
```

If you need to re-run the Sonar phase, please be sure to specify at least the `initialize` phase since Sonar properties are loaded from the sonar-project.properties file.

```
./mvnw initialize sonar:sonar
```
or
<%_ } else if (buildTool === 'gradle') { _%>
```
./gradlew -Pprod clean check jacocoTestReport sonarqube
```
<%_ } _%>

For more information, refer to the [Code quality page][].

## Using Docker to simplify development (optional)

You can use Docker to improve your JHipster development experience. A number of docker-compose configuration are available in the [src/main/docker](src/main/docker) folder to launch required third party services.
<% if (databaseType !== 'no') { %>
For example, to start a <%= prodDatabaseType %> database in a docker container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/<%= prodDatabaseType %>.yml up -d

To stop it and remove the container, run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/<%= prodDatabaseType %>.yml down
<% } %>
You can also fully dockerize your application and all the services that it depends on.
To achieve this, first build a docker image of your app by running:

    <% if (buildTool === 'maven') { %>./mvnw -Pprod verify jib:dockerBuild<% } %><% if (buildTool === 'gradle') { %>../gradlew clean assemble dockerBuild -Pprod<% } %>
    <% if (buildTool === 'gradle') { %>
    Gradle uses official [micronaut-gradle-plugin](https://github.com/micronaut-projects/micronaut-gradle-plugin) for Docker image generation.
    <% } %><% if (buildTool === 'maven') { %>
    Maven uses [jib](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/gcp/introducing-jib-build-java-docker-images-better) for Docker image generation.
    <% } %>
Then run:

    docker-compose -f src/main/docker/app.yml up -d

For more information refer to [Using Docker and Docker-Compose][], this page also contains information on the docker-compose sub-generator (`jhipster docker-compose`), which is able to generate docker configurations for one or several JHipster applications.
